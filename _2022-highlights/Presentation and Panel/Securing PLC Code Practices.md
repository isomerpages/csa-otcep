##### Synopsis:

<p style="text-align:justify"><font size="3">Cybersecurity Incident responding is commonly unheard in the OT environment, and the main responders to issues are typically OT engineers/operators or vendors, often resetting the devices or process to restore operations which may deny a discovery of a cyber breach. These may be caused by user interaction with Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) or software is not always simple and are limited in scope, and caused a lack of visibility or centralised data aggregation. Therefore, it is important to combine Engineering "Forensics" with Digital Forensics in such instances.</font></p><br><br>
