##### Synopsis:

<p style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Stealthy exploits of programmable logic controllers are among the rarest, most time-consuming, and investment-heavy attacks. The ability to conceal malicious bytecode on a PLC and give engineers the appearance of operations running as normal is highly sophisticated, and poses extreme risk to process safety and reliability. Without advanced forensics utilities, the execution of such malicious code cannot be discovered. In this presentation, it will cover the research into such stealthy exploits and how we were able to attack PLCs manufactured by leading ICS vendors including Rockwell Automation, and Siemens.</font></p><br><br>
