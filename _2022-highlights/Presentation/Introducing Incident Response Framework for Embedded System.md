<font size=5><b> Synopsis: </b></font>

<p style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Cybersecurity Incident responding is commonly unheard in the OT environment, and the main responders to issues are typically OT engineers/operators or vendors, often resetting the devices or process to restore operations which may deny a discovery of a cyber breach. These may be caused by user interaction with Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) or software is not always simple and are limited in scope, and caused a lack of visibility or centralised data aggregation. Therefore, it is important to combine Engineering "Forensics" with Digital Forensics in such instances. The panel discussion on the introducing incident response framework for embedded system continues.</font></p><br><br>
