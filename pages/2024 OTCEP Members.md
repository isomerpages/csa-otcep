<p>Robert is a recognised authority in the industrial cybersecurity community.
He is CEO and co-founder of Dragos, a global technology leader in cybersecurity
for industrial controls systems (ICS)/operational technology (OT) environments.</p>
<p>In addition, Robert serves on the Department of Energy's Electricity Advisory
Committee as the Vice Chair of the Department of Energy's Grid Resilience
for National Security Subcommittee, and is a member of the World Economic
Forum's subcommittees on Cyber Resilience for the Oil &amp; Gas and Electricity
communities.</p>
<p>Robert is routinely sought after for advice and input on cybersecurity
for industrial infrastructure and is regularly asked to brief national
leaders. He testified to the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on
Energy and Commerce--Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, and
to the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, to advise on
policy issues related to critical infrastructure cyber threats. He is a
member on the Reserve Forces Policy Board, Office of the Secretary of Defense;
and also serves on the board of the National Cryptologic Foundation. He
has also presented at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos,
and industry leading conferences such as RSA, SANS, BlackHat, and DefCon
on the topic of industrial cybersecurity and threats.</p>
<p>Robert began his pioneering work in ICS/OT cybersecurity as a U.S. Air
Force Cyber Warfare Operations Officer tasked to the National Security
Agency, where he built a first-of-its-kind mission identifying and analysing
national threats to industrial infrastructure. He went on to build the
industrial community's first dedicated monitoring and incident response
class at the SANS Institute (ICS515) and the industry recognised cyber
threat intelligence course (FOR578).</p>
<p>SC Media named Robert the Security Executive of the Year for 2022. A business
leader but also technical practitioner, he helped lead the investigation
into the 2015 attack on Ukraine's power grid, the first time an electric
system was taken down due to a cyberattack. With his team at Dragos he
has been involved in the most significant cyberattacks on industrial infrastructure,
including the investigation and analysis of the 2016 attack on Ukraine’s
electric system, the 2017 TRISIS attack on a Saudi Arabian petrochemical
facility in the first attempt to try to kill people through malicious software,
and the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack. In 2022, his team at
Dragos uncovered PIPEDREAM, a highly flexible framework to attack industrial
infrastructure globally. Robert’s work has been featured in the book Sandworm
and on 60 Minutes.</p>
