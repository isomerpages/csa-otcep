For over 20 years, Dale Peterson has been on the leading/bleeding edge helping security- conscious asset owners effectively and efficiently manage risk to their critical assets. He has pioneered numerous Industrial Control Systems (ICS) security tools and techniques, such as the first intrusion detection signatures for ICS that are now in every commercial product. In 2007, he created S4 Events to showcase the best offensive and defensive work in ICS security and build a community. S4 is now the largest and most advanced ICS event in the world.
