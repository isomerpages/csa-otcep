| 10.45am–11.45am | **Presentation and Panel Discussion – Security By Design**   <br><br>Security by Design recently took a prominent position in many countries’ cybersecurity policies. The term “security by design” stems from software engineering. To apply it to Industrial Control Systems (ICS), some misconceptions must be resolved – for example that security by design is mainly a vendors’ issue. For ICS, the asset owners are involved in security by design as well. But vendors, integrators and asset owners share the problem that ICS engineers don’t have time and security expertise to address security by design. Sarah spent the last three years researching what engineers need to design “their” ICS securely even though they still have a “real” job, and she shares the resulting methodology “Security by design decisions” that has is currently being validated with both a vendor (HIMA) and an asset owner (INEOS). The method is not reinventing the wheel, but builds upon core concepts from cutting edge approaches like INL’s CIE / CCE (Cyber-Informed Engineering), MIT’s STPA (System-Theoretic Process Analysis), and MITRE’s ATT&amp;CK; it is consequence-driven and model-based. Because the focus remains on making life for a human security decision-maker as easy as possible, the entire method is visualized in interactive “security diagrams<br><br> <b>Ms Sarah Fluchs</b><br>Chief Technology Officer, admeritia GmbH <br><br>                                                                                                                                          |
