| 09:00-<br> 09:05<br> | Welcome Speech<br><br><li><b>Mr David Koh,</b> Commissioner of Cybersecurity & Chief Executive, Cyber Security Agency of Singapore</li><br><br>
| 09:05-<br> 09:15<br> |Keynote Speech<br><br><b>Mrs Josephine Teo,</b> Minister for Communications and<br> Information and Second Minister for Home Affairs; <br>Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation And Cybersecurity<br><br>|
| 09:15-<br> 10:45<br> | Presentation and Panel Discussion - The latest Industrial Control System Malware <br><br><b>Robert M. Lee,</b> CEO & Co-Founder, Dragos, Inc<br><br><font size="2"><i>Pipedream/InController emerges as the latest ICS Malware that is tailored to target specific Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) commonly found in Industrial Control System (ICS) that could be expanded to other similar targets in the Operational Technology (OT) Sectors. Though this threat (seem to target U.S. Liquid Natural Gas and Key Electric Power Site) have not employed their capability for its intended disruptive in nature,  there is still potential of the capabilities being deployed in Singapore.</i></font><br><br>|

| 11:15-<br> 12:45<br> | Presentation and Panel Discussion - Security Truth or Consequences <br><br><b>Dale Peterson,</b> Founder & Program Chair, S4 Events; Founder & Chief Executive Officer, Digital Bond Inc<br><br><font size="2"><i>Most incidents (include cyber) are caused due to human errors. We may think that more security controls mean more secured, hence human start investing more, and more funds are injected into such controls to protect themselves from the risk. While we can implement controls to mitigate the risks of the incident from happening,  the impact/consequence may continue to be catastrophic if it had not been reduced. Will this be the case moving forward?</i></font><br><br>|

| 14:00-<br> 15:30<br> | Presentation and Panel Discussion – Introducing Incident Response Framework for Embedded System<br><br> <b>Joel Langill,</b> Founder & Managing Member, Industrial Control System Cyber Security Institute (ICSCSI) LLC; Founder, SCADAhacker<br><br><font size="2"><i>Cybersecurity Incident responding is commonly unheard in the OT environment, and the main responders to issues are typically OT engineers/operators or vendors, often resetting the devices or process to restore operations which may deny a discovery of a cyber breach. These may be caused by user interaction with Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) or software is not always simple and are limited in scope, and caused a lack of visibility or centralised data aggregation. Therefore, it is important to combine Engineering "Forensics" with Digital Forensics in such instances.</i></font><br><br>|
| 15:30-<br> 16:00<br> | Break <br><br><br>|
| 16:00-<br> 17:30<br> | Presentation and Panel Discussion – Securing PLC Code Practices<br><br> <b>Sarah Fluchs,</b> CTO, Admeritia GmbH<br><br><font size="2"><i>For many years, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are usually insecure by design. Several years into customising and applying best practices from IT gave rise to secure protocols, encrypted communications, network segmentation etc. However, to date, there has not been a focus on using the characteristic features in PLCs (or SCADA/DCS) for security, or how to program PLCs with security in mind. </i></font><br>|
