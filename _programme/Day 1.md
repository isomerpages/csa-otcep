| Time     | Agenda                                        |
| -------  | ---------                                        |
| 09:00-<br> 09:05     | Welcome Speech<br><br><b>Mr David Koh, Commissioner of Cybersecurity & Chief Executive,<br> Cyber Security Agency of Singapore</b> <br>
| 09:05-<br>09:15       | Keynote Speech<br><br><b>Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Communications and<br> Information and Second Minister for Home Affairs</b> <br>|
| 09:15-<br> 10:45 | Presentation and Panel Discussion - The latest Industrial Control System Malware <br> <i>The latest ICS Malware Pipedream/InController emerges as the latest Industrial Control System (ICS) Malware that is tailored to target specific Programmable Logic Controller commonly found in ICS that could be expanded to other similar targets in the OT Sectors.</i> <br><br>|
| 10:45-<br>11:10    |  Break <br><br>|
|11:10-<br> 12:45     | Presentation and Panel Discussion - Security Truth or Consequences <br> <i> Most of incidents (including cyber) are due to human errors. We may think that more security controls mean systems are more secured, hence human start investing more funds into such controls to protect their systems from the cyber risks. While we can implement controls to mitigate the risks of incidents from taking place, the impact and consequence may continue to be catastrophic if it had not been reduced. Will this the case moving forward? </i> <br>|
| 12:45-<br> 14:00    | Lunch <br><br>|
| 14:00-<br> 15:30    | Presentation and Panel Discussion – OT Incident Response <br> <i>Stealthy exploits of programmable logic controllers are among the rarest, most time-consuming, and investment-heavy attacks. The ability to conceal malicious bytecode on a Programmable Logic Controller give engineers the appearance of operations running as normal is highly sophisticated, poses extreme risk to process safety and reliability. Without advanced forensics utilities, the ability to detect execution of such malicious code would be a challenge. </i> <br>|
| 15:30-<br> 16:00    | Break <br><br>|
| 16:00-<br> 17:30    | Presentation and Panel Discussion – Securing PLC Code Practices <br> <i> For many years, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) have been insecure by design. Several years into customizing and applying best practices from IT gave rise to secure protocols, encrypted communications, network segmentation etc. However, to date, there has not been a focus on using the characteristic features in PLCs (or SCADA/DCS) for security, or how to program PLCs with security in mind. </i> <br>|
