| 9:00-<br> 10:30<br> | <u>Technical Conversation: OT Cybersecurity in Secured Engineering</u><br><br>Moderator:<br>**Sharon Brizinov, Director of Security Research, Claroty**<br><br><p style="text-align:justify">OT system was originally designed on a flat communication network for "stuff" to work, not for security. Adversary had create real-life cases that disrupt/destruct on these unsecured system, and had defenders scrambling to protect their system to prevent re-occurrences. Furthermore, OT system is susceptible by emerging cyber threat vectors, standardization, and interoperability issues, bridging the gaps at the IT/OT ICS (industrial control systems) level. Defender is trying very hard to level up their capabilities to secure the OT environment, combining the engineering concepts with security methodology for a better secured OT system.</p><br><br><br>|
| 10:30-<br> 12:00<br>  | <u>Technical Sharing: Hidden Code on Field Controllers</u><br><br> <i>Stealthy exploits of programmable logic controllers are among the rarest, most time-consuming, and investment-heavy attacks. The ability to conceal malicious bytecode on a PLC and give engineers the appearance of operations running as normal is highly sophisticated, and poses extreme risk to process safety and reliability. Without advanced forensics utilities, the execution of such malicious code cannot be discovered. <br><br>In this presentation, it will cover the research into such stealthy exploits and how we were able to attack PLCs manufactured by leading ICS vendors including Rockwell Automation, and Siemens.<i/><br><br>|
