### About OTCEP

<p style="text-align:justify">Established in May 2021, the Operational Technology Cybersecurity Expert Panel (OTCEP) allows Singapore’s Operational Technology (OT) cybersecurity practitioners, operators, researchers, and policy makers from the Government, Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) sectors, academia and other OT industries to have direct access to internationally renowned experts. Drawing from appointed members’ respective experience in OT domains in engineering, operations and governance, these stakeholders can tap on their existing capabilities to enhance the cyber resilience of Singapore’s OT sector.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The OTCEP discusses issues ranging from governance policies and processes, evolving OT technologies, emerging trends, capability development, supply chain, threat intelligent information sharing and incident response. They also recommend best practices to address cybersecurity challenges and gaps in the OT sector.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The OTCEP augments efforts under the OT Cybersecurity Masterplan which was developed to enhance the security and resilience of Singapore’s critical sectors, improve cross-sector response to mitigate cyber threats in the OT environment and strengthen partnerships with stakeholders.</p>

The event will run from 12 July to 13 July 2022*.
