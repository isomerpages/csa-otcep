<p style="text-align:left">The establishment of an Operational Technology Cybersecurity Expert Panel  (OTCEP) was first announced at the Singapore International Cyber Week 2020. The OTCEP forum augments efforts under the OT Cybersecurity Masterplan which was developed to enhance the security and resilience of Singapore’s critical sectors, improve cross-sector response to mitigate cyber threats in the OT environment and strengthen partnerships with stakeholders.</p>

<p style="text-align:left">Cyber threats to OT, especially Industrial Control Systems (ICS), are increasing in frequency and sophistication. It is therefore imperative to strengthen local cybersecurity capabilities and competencies in the OT sector.</p>

<p style="text-align:left">The OTCEP forum will allow Singapore’s OT cybersecurity practitioners, operators, Industry, researchers, and policy makers from the Government, Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) sectors, academia and other OT industries to engage internationally renowned experts. Drawing from appointed members’ respective experience in OT domains in engineering, operations and governance, the OTCEP forum will discuss key global OT technologies, emerging cyber threats, share insights from their experience in handling global cybersecurity incidents, and recommend practices to address cybersecurity challenges and gaps for the OT sector. </p>
